# Starsector Industry
This mod is an addition of several different Industries to the game adding depth and choice in ways I found enjoyable. It also adds an AI to the game that will build the base games buildings, this mods buildings and Industrial.Evolution's if it is installed. This mod has no hard dependencies, but I strongly recommend Grand.Colonies if you are playing with Nexerelin and can capture very full markets.

## Install
- Clone this repository or download a release zip and copy into the mod's directory of your starsector 0.96's mod folder
- (Optional) Open the data/config/settings.json and configure it how you like. I included settings.json.optional to show you what I use.

## Summary of Industries Added
### Regular Industry
#### Hydroponic Farming
A simple farming building that can be built anywhere, provides minimal food stock to a colony, non additive with other farming.

#### Rural Farm Co-Op
A farming industry extension that provides a small bonus production to the primary Farming industry and some minimal redundancy 

#### State Farms
#### Industrial Farming
#### Automated Farming
Stacking farming extensions that provide large bonus production to the primary Farming industry and meaningful redundancies

#### Aquaculture Extensions
An aquaculture extension that provides a bonus production to the primary and provides some redundancy.

#### Trace Mining
A polluting industry that adds a small bonus to mining, including to types you normally wouldn't have access to.

A polluting industry that adds a substantial bonus to fuel production.

### Additional Infrastructure

Adds a market to the colony even in systems with an existing trade center/Commerce industry along with steep upkeep requirements.

An expensive structure that adds a massive access bonus and population boom.

#### Civilian Infrastructure (Common)
#### Civilian Infrastructure (Luxury)
#### Transportation Infrastructure
Structures that provide minimal access and population growth rate bonuses.

### Military

Provides an immediate force when one is needed; not really cost effective.

A naval force that will guard jump points/gates and stable orbital assets.

#### Industrial Defense Force
A standard extension or standalone naval force that performs the same actions as the standard military bases.

### "Questionable Morality"

#### Authoritarian Regime
#### Police State
Provides stability bonuses at the cost of growth rate.
- Will cause rep loss with some factions in the future; have not thought that through enough though.

#### Chop Shop
Produces organs at the cost of your population
- Will cause rep loss with some factions in the future; have not thought that through enough though.
